2008-07-01:
* Fixed IRCBot to be part of the net/yail namespace so you can subclass
  without copying the file into your own project
* Fixed IRCBot to actually be usable (fixed require)

2008-07-02:
* Minor documentation fixes
* Args aren't automatically duped for all handlers anymore, as that caused
  output handling to break (args come in, go to handler, get duped, get
  filtered, handler chain ends, required YAIL output methods finish with the
  original, unfiltered args)
* All output APIs now dup the args at the top level to deal with above issue
* Added more details to Rakefile - homepage and rubyforge project
* Bumped to version 1.0.2 - will release gem only after a little testing,
  though

2008-07-03:
* IRCBot can now auto-join multiple channels, and has a built-in uptime
  system.
* Net::YAIL now has handling for INVITE messages
* Added fully working logger bot for a solid example
* Since changes are more extensive than a minor release, bumping to 1.1.1

2008-07-07:
* The included logger example bot no longer crashes on incoming "private"
  message
* Logger example also has an example of using an outgoing handler to
  centralize a list of channel passwords - all join messages get a password
  tacked on if the central password list has one for the given channel
* Obviously the above addition required support for joining password-protected
  channels, so YAY!

2008-07-17:
* Fixed logger's handler to not call the channel logging code on private message
* Figured it's about time for a new gem, 1.2.0.  Change to join handler breaks
  existing code in a minor way - don't forget to fix your handlers!

2008-07-22:
* Added a bunch of new output APIs and corresponding outgoing handlers
* Auto-support for server password with new arg to constructor
* Moved TODO stuff into a separate file outside the gem's evil influence!

2008-07-??:
* Fixed up a bunch of code to add a bit more stability for dead sockets and
  such.
* IRCBot can now properly reconnect when the socket does end up dying.
* Bumped version to 1.2.1.  Probably a good time to release another gem.
