* CTCP formatting:
  * Color is ^C<fore>[,<back>]
  * Bold is ^B to toggle on or off
* CTCP commands (VERSION, PING, etc): http://www.invlogic.com/irc/ctcp.html
* Extract all pattern matching into an external file - store both the
  pattern and the event handle's symbol.
* To deal with the required post-handler logic in the output API, and
  "nicely" deal with filtering output, it may be better to have a separate
  hash of YAIL-required post-handlers.  This would allow all logic to be
  done as handlers (makes things more consistent)
* Steal below snippet from perl's irc lib - seems to parse the numeric
  handlers nicely-ish - gets "from", "type", and an array of "other" data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  my ($from, $type, $stuff) = split(/\s+/, $line, 3);
  my ($blip, $space, $other, @stuff);
  while ($stuff) {
    ($blip, $space, $other) = split(/(\s+)/, $stuff, 2);
    $space = "" unless $space;
    $other = "" unless $other;       # Thanks to jack velte...
    if ($blip =~ /^:/) {
      push @stuff, $blip . $space . $other;
      last;
    } else {
      push @stuff, $blip;
      $stuff = $other;
    }
  }
